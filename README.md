Project 4: Whack-A-Mole

Simple game of whacking moles.

This is an interesting venture into seeing how far my skills have come.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Game reqs:
1. A grid for the moles to be on. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5
2. Moles popping their heads up and back down. This will require a toggle between a dirt mound and the moles head. 
3. On-click of the mole will result in earning points and making the mole go back underground.
4. A score tracking system after hitting moles.
5. Randomize the amount of moles that pop up, the intervals of time for them popping up and the moles will only be up for a certain amount of time.
6. A timer for how long the round is.

Extras if possible:
1. Increasing speed of moles popping up and going down.
2. Different kinds of moles (some worth more points or some that will lose you points)
3. Combo streaks
